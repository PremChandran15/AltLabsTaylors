If you remember back to the lessons on strings and lists, remember that we used a function len() to get the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.\n",

    "    #return desired result\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with def then a space followed by the name of the function. Try to keep names relevant, for example len() is a good name for a length() function. Also be careful with names, you wouldn't want to call a function the same name as a [built-in function in Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) (such as len).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next come a pair of parenthesis with a number of arguments separated by a comma. These arguments are the inputs for your function. You'll be able to use these inputs in your function and reference them. After this you put a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here is the important step, you must indent to begin the code inside your function correctly. Python makes use of *whitespace* to organize code. Lots of other programing languages do not do this, so keep that in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you'll see the doc-string, this is where you write a basic description of the function. Using iPython and iPython Notebooks, you'll be ab;e to read these doc-strings by pressing Shift+Tab after a function name. Doc strings are not necessary for simple functions, but its good practice to put them in so you or other people can easily understand the code you write.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all this you begin writing the code you wish to execute.\n",
